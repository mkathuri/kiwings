#  KiWings

## Introduction
Its a front-end for `kiwix-serve`. That's it. The uninitiated may read on. Others can skip the rest of this section.

The name is based on and closely resembles the underlying project this UI is based upon - [Kiwix](https://www.kiwix.org/). It is an open-source tool that allows you to read offline copies of fantastic content like Wikipedia (its a 80GB download), TED Talks etc. The product does what it is advertised to do, but it could indeed use a lot of improvements. For example: the Kiwix app (on macOS at least), is unable to view TED videos (no audio ðŸ˜•).

### Probing Further
The Kiwix team also releases a command-line tool called `kiwix-serve`, which can serve as a server that can serve content from a given URL and port (e.g. localhost:8080). The benefit of using this tool is that it is lightweight and you can view all your content in the web-browser. And I can finally play my TED zims, at least on chromium-based browsers like Edge and Google Chrome. Unfortunately, it doesn't work in Safari. So, it seems one needs Chromium Engine to view TED videos on Kiwix.

### Going even further
`kiwix-serve` is compatible with macOS, but the Kiwix team doesn't release any standalone binaries for macOS yet due to some differences in how compilation works on macOS compared to other OSes. They are working on it though, but they've got their hands pretty full of other things. Luckily, due to the foundations already being in place, I've managed to build standalone binaries for `kiwix-serve` and other `kiwix-tools` and I've tested that things work well, at least on the latest version of macOS Big Sur 11.4 and macOS 12 beta.

> ðŸ”¥Please be advised, THIS TOOL IS NOT TESTED FOR GENERAL USE. On my part, I'm releasing the tool as a sandboxed app, but this tool is RELEASED AS IS, WITH NO WARRANTY - IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE. Being a sandboxed app, there's not much damage this app can do (it doesn't write anywhere, only has read-only permission for your ZIM files). Still, its better to exercise caution.
> 
> If you feel some things like LICENSE, CREDITS etc. are missing, rest assured, I'm taking my time adding them to the app. Remember, this is still a work in progress.

## Installation & Requirements
- Please make sure you have macOS 11.3 or greater installed on your machine.

- Open the DMG file in Finder.
- Drag and Drop the KiWings app into your Applications folder.

## Build Instructions
There are 3 simple steps: Checkout the project, you open the project in Xcode and you build it. Easy, right?

## Wishes
I would love to host this app on the macOS App Store (and avail all the nice features like automatic updates), once I have some money to enroll into Apple's Developer Program. 99 USD/yr ain't exactly cheap.

## I've got feedback
Great. Two things you should know here: I designed this tool in accordance with my own use-cases, and I'm really short on time these days. So, it may not be possible for me to attend to your concerns. Feel free to raise a GitHub issue or send me any feedback if you'd like, I'll see what I can do about it.
